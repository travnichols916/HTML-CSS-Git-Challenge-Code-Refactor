HTML, CSS, & Git Challenge Code Refractor Read Me


Web Accessibility has become an increasingly higher concern with consideration to the many devices people are using nowadays. For clear and concise understanding of the code there are certain elements that will make the HTML and CSS sheets more understanding for the newer user so the changes that were made helped the over functionality and made the coding more "clean". 



User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
